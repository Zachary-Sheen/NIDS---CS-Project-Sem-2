<p align="center"><strong>I made a working NIDS with Scapy and Python using AbuseIPDB as an API</strong>
<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>My project is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that takes in packets in transit and reads their contents to determine if they are malicious or not.  I built this project because I didn't want to just make another game or website, but wanted to actually build something that uses contents of what I want to do in the future.  I have gotten very interested in cybersecurity, and I loved doing this project to learn more about it.</strong><br/>


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong>For this project I had three goals: <hr> 1: Be able to analyze captured packets and dissect them into information I can use <hr> 2: Implement an algorithm that can determine if some activity is suspicious<hr> 3:Once being able to figure out if a packet is suspicious, alert and record the packet to the system(log and report all issues)</strong><br/>

 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>For this sprint, I am going to try to integrate a malicious IP database that I can reference with each IP address I check.  I am going to use AbuseIPDB, which is a free database that contains reports of malicious IP adresses and integrate it into my code.</strong><br/>
