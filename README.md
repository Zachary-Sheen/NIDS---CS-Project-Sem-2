<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>My project is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that takes in packets in transit and reads their contents to determine if they are malicious or not.  I built this project because I didn't want to just make another game or website, but wanted to actually build something that uses contents of what I want to do in the future.  I have gotten very interested in cybersecurity, and I loved doing this project to learn more about it.</strong><br/>


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong>For this project I had three goals: <hr> 1: Be able to analyze captured packets and dissect them into information I can use <hr> 2: Implement an algorithm that can determine if some activity is suspicious<hr> 3:Once being able to figure out if a packet is suspicious, alert and record the packet to the system(log and report all issues)<hr>  My only non-goal was to expand my knowledge of the world of cybersecurity using Python.<hr>  Link to design doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1so951MYNsgI0iNlArCSiIPoMQzJsEj7ixOSP7xd7ArQ/edit?usp=sharing</strong><br/>
 
 
 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>For this sprint, I am going to try to integrate a malicious IP database that I can reference with each IP address I check.  I am going to use AbuseIPDB, which is a free database that contains reports of malicious IP adresses and integrate it into my code.</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>This project, I learned a lot about networks and how to use python to access and break down informations that travel through networks.  Also, I finally learned how to integrate an API into my code, which was a lot of fun.  If I had more time to do this, I would've liked to make something (website or gui) that allows the user to check specific packets or just access a Wi-Fi and the packets coming into it.</strong><br/>

<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong>To run my project, you open your terminal and go to the directory of the project and run the python script using python3.  Doing this would automatically tap into your Wi-FI and analyze packets coming in.</strong><br/>
